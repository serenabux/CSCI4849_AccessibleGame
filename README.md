# CSCI4849_AccessibleGame
EmojiMe is a face controlled app with three features. The first is an emoji generator which will generate an emoji based on the face the user is making. The second is a game of Simon Says where the user has to match their face to the face of the emoji if Simon Says but if Simon doesn't say then they must make it as different as possible. The final mode is callibration where the user matches the face of each emoji. This is then averaged with all previous entries. 

# Motivation 
Design an accessible game that takes a different form of input. To make the game more accessible it requires the user to callibrate the app to the way they match the Emojis. That way if the user has difficulty matching an emoji they can come up with an adaptation and can still play the game without great difficulty.

# System Requirments
To run the app an iOS device with a True Depth Camera (iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, or iPhone XR. iPad Pro (11-inch) or iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 3rd generation)) is required.
